>#### **Status: In Progress üöß**

[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/AzzaEid/HMS)

## üìë About the Project

This project is a **Medical Management System API** designed using **Clean Architecture Principles** and built with **ASP.NET Core Web API**.  
It simulates a real-world clinic/hospital environment by managing **Patients**, **Doctors**, **Appointments**, **Prescriptions**, **Medications**, and **Billing**.  
It demonstrates advanced backend engineering techniques covering **authentication, authorization, pagination, ordering, localization, validation, error handling, logging**, and more.

## üéØ Main Features

- Full **CRUD Operations** for all entities
- **Authentication & Authorization** with JWT, Roles, and Claims
- **Role-based Access Control** (Admin, Doctor, Patient)
- **Automated Email Handling** (confirmation, password reset)
- **Secure Passwords & Refresh Tokens**
- **Logging** using Serilog (Database + Console)
- **Localization** (multi-language support)
- **Pagination**, **Ordering**, **Filtering**
- **Exception Handling** with Middlewares
- **Entity Relationships** fully implemented

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

This project follows a **Clean Architecture** pattern, separating concerns into:

- **Domain Layer**: Entities and Core Logic
- **Application Layer**: Use Cases, DTOs, Interfaces
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Database Access, External Services
- **Presentation Layer**: Web API Controllers

With a strong focus on:

- Dependency Injection (DI)
- Mediator Pattern
- Repository & Unit of Work Pattern
- Fluent Validation
- AutoMapper
- Custom Response Wrappers
- API Versioning & Routing Customization

## üß± Entities and Their Relationships

| Entity | Relationships |
|:---|:---|
| **Patient** | Has many Appointments, Prescriptions, and Bills |
| **Doctor** | Has many Appointments and Prescriptions |
| **Department** | Has many Doctors, Managed by one Doctor (ManagerDoctor) |
| **Appointment** | Belongs to a Patient and a Doctor |
| **Prescription** | Belongs to a Patient and a Doctor, Contains many Medications |
| **Medication** | Can belong to many Prescriptions |
| **Bill** | Belongs to a Prescription |

## üî• Authentication & Authorization

- **Register** (with roles Admin, Doctor, Patient): `POST /api/auth/register`
- **Login** (JWT + Refresh Token): `POST /api/auth/login`
- **Role and Claim Based Authorization**
- **Password Reset** and **Email Confirmation** with encryption.
